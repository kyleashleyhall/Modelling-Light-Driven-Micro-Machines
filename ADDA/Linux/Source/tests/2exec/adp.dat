# Description of the coverage of the whole solid angle for integration 
#
# This file should be manually modified by user. 
# Program does not assume any symmetries of the particle.
# Therefore, possible symmetries should be considered by user and this can lead
# to decrease of integration limits 

theta:
# default: min=0;max=180;Jmin=2;Jmax=6;eps=0;equiv=false;periodic=false
min=0
max=90
Jmin=2
Jmax=4
eps=0
equiv=false
periodic=false

phi:
# default: min=0;max=360;Jmin=2;Jmax=5;eps=0;equiv=true;periodic=true
# axysymmmetrical: max=90;equiv=false;Jmax=3 -> discard values of g.x and g.y 
#   (consider them zero)
min=0
max=135
Jmin=2
Jmax=3
eps=0
equiv=false
periodic=false

# all angles are specified in degrees
# all values are precalculated; so high 'eps' does not decrease computational 
# time, but may decrease accuracy. If eps=0, Jmin is not used.

# Jmin,Jmax are minimum and maximum numbers of refinement stages
# Nmax = 2^Jmax + 1
# for those with equiv=true Nmax is effectively less by 1 
# total calls of function <= Nmax_theta * Nmax_phi

# equiv means whether it is assumed that max and min values 
# are completely equivalent. If true only one of them is calculated.

# periodic means whether function is periodic in the integrated interval.
# If true trapezoid rule is used; it is possible that interval is half of the
#   function period.

# axysymmetrical <=> particle with z - axis of symmetry
