1. Verification_planar - This was an experimental test to compare how our calculated forces compared with those of ADDA in a Planar wave set up

2. VaryingBeamSpatialIncrement - This was an experimental test illustrating the effect of varying the spatial increment between calculations as the beam moves over the particle

3. Verification_dpl - This was an experimental test illustrating the effect of varying the dpl number for a constant spatial increment as the beam moves over the particle
