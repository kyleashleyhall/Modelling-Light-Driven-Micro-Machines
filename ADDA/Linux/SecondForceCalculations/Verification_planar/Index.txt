1. Verification_Planar_30dpl_Simon_New - The first run of the new script under Simon's test case scenario (Total forces incorrect)

CalculateDDAForces_New - The new Force calculation with ADDA running alongside

CalculateDDAForces_New_alphaE - The new Force calculation using alphaE instead of DipPol

CalculateDDAForces_New_PointTest - Checks individual dipoles on the grid, requires the Grid Calculator in the Scripts folder to understand where each dipole is in the 3d space
