# Description of the parameters for orientation averaging
#
# this file should be manually modified by user
# Program does not assume any symmetries of the particle. Therefore, possible symmetries should be considered by user
# and this can lead to decrease of integration limits. 
# Here zyz-notation (or y-convention) is used for the Euler angles.

alpha:
# calculation for alpha is cheap but only precalculated, therefore Jmax should be rather large.
# Jmin and eps are really not used.
# Completely irrelevant, when only cross sections are calculated ('-scat_matr none').
# Do not change the range from default unless you have a good reason; using only one value of gamma for beta=0,pi is
#   done only when full range is specified here to avoid possible inaccuracies.
# default: min=0;max=360;Jmax=5;equiv=true;periodic=true
min=0
max=360
Jmin=2
Jmax=5
eps=0
equiv=true
periodic=true

beta:
# default: min=0;max=180;Jmin=2;Jmax=4;eps=1e-3;equiv=false;periodic=false
# xy - symmetry plane: max=90;Jmax=3
# Do not use periodic=true since the function is multiplied by sin(beta) before integration.
min=0
max=180
Jmin=2
Jmax=4
eps=1e-3
equiv=false
periodic=false

gamma:
# default: min=0;max=360;Jmin=2;Jmax=4;eps=1e-3;equiv=true;periodic=true
# axysymmetrical: max=0
#   more precisely: max=45;Jmax=2;equiv=false
min=0
max=360
Jmin=2
Jmax=4
eps=1e-3
equiv=true
periodic=true

# all angles are specified in degrees
# Jmin,Jmax are minimum and maximum numbers of refinement stages
# Nmax = 2^Jmax + 1
# for those with equiv=true Nmax is effectively less by 1 
# total calls of function <= Nmax_theta * Nmax_phi

# equiv means whether it is assumed that max and min values are completely equivalent. If true only one of them is
# calculated.

# periodic means whether function is periodic in the integrated interval. If true trapezoid rule is used; it is possible
# that interval is half of the function period.

# axysymmetrical <=> particle with z - axis of symmetry
