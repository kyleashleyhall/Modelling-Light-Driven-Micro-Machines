# default: min=0;max=360;Jmin=2;Jmax=5;eps=0;equiv=true;periodic=true
# axysymmetrical: max=0
#   more precisely: max=45;Jmax=3;equiv=false
#   then discard values of some Mueller matrix elements integrated with 
#     cos/sin multipliers (those that should be =0).

# all angles are specified in degrees
# all values are precalculated; so high 'eps' does not decrease computational 
# time, but may decrease accuracy
# Jmin,Jmax are minimum and maximum numbers of refinement stages
# Nmax = 2^Jmax + 1
# for those with equiv=true Nmax is effectively less by 1 
# total calls of function <= Nmax_theta * Nmax_phi
# when equiv=true, it is assumed that max and min values 
#   are completely equivalent (together with values of cos/sin multipliers, 
#   when applicable). Only one of them is calculated. 
# periodic means whether function is periodic in the integrated interval.
# If true trapezoid rule is used; it is possible that interval is half of the
#   function period.
# axysymmetrical <=> particle with z - axis of symmetry

# parameters that are not needed are just ignored (can be omitted)
