Utils for automatic cross-testing different ADDA executables (by comparing the simulation results). The main part is a
bash script 'comp2exec'. Under Windows one may use MSYS to run it. This script contains comments in the head and
throughout the file to explain its usage. In particular, one may specify the particular executables to cross test (a few
typical pairs can be selected by command line options to this script).

The particular tests to perform are specified by file 'suite', by a list of command lines with certain additions and
abbreviations (see comments in the file). Currently, this file provides an extensive list of tests for testing future
ADDA versions against a stable release. Some of this tests probably need to be removed for more specific tests, since
they will produce errors. A different file (instead of 'suite') can also be used, if specified by command line option to
'comp2exec'.

Another important part is script 'diff_numeric.awk', which compares two files with given numerical tolerance. It may
also need modification to fit a specific application.
