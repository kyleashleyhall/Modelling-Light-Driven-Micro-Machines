"Point in Polyhedron" transforms .obj files into DDSCAT7 shape format.

Authors: Roman Schuh and Thomas Wriedt, using routines by John Burkardt.

To compile under Unix type "make" in current directory. Windows executables are available in corresponding ADDA packages.

Executable is named 'pip', it accepts a single command line parameter: maximum shape size in dipoles along the largest
dimension that is determined automatically. Input shape is read from 'shape.obj' and DDSCAT7 shape is saved into
'shape.dat'. Both filenames are hardcoded in 'FEM-Geo-Wr.f90'.

It should be possible to read other 3D formats, which are supported by routines in 'ivread_wr.f90' - see comments in the
source files. However, only .obj format is sufficiently tested. Moreover, the algorithm requires consistent alignment of
face normals - they should all point outward.

To test executable run "pip 20" in the current folder. It will use provided 'shape.obj' that defines a star-shaped
object and produce 'shape.dat' which should be identical to provided 'shape_test.dat'.

Finally, The DDSCAT7 shape format is readable by ADDA starting from version 1.1. ADDA 1.0 can read only DDSCAT6 format,
so delete line 6 in obtained .dat files to transform it into such format.
